This paper basically states that tech is responsible for inducing lasting social and economical change.  Unfortunately, right now the social and economical change technology brings is overlook by literature in literature.  It is not brought up because it is assumed that the social and economic change is already known and understood without saying.  Unfortunately this is not the case.  It should be viewed oh how it changes the framework of an evolutionary epistemology of technical knowledge.  

I believe this to be true.  For example, if I wanted to best describe cell phone technology, I would have to accurately paint the picture of a world without cell phones.  There are many looked over details by an onlooker with no experience of that time.  They might not realize how hard it was to switch plans while you were out of the house if you were meeting someone, or of something went wrong.  They might not think how anyone could overhear your conversations if they picked up a different phone in the house during your conversions. They might not realize that communication past a certain hour was not done because colling someone's household would wake everyone living there.  

I agree that you really have to go over the ecosystem of the world before the technology was around in order for someone to truly understand the social and economical impact of technology.
