Only a couple improvements I see
1.  Hash code for StopWatchImplementation should also check on other elements of the 
	stopwatch to determine that they are different.  If how ID is created is changed, 
	then this would break.  I would love it see the LapTime and Status to also be 
	checked
	
2. 	Equals is also done incorrectly.  There is no check for null. Also instead of 
	checking if object == this, instead they must access the different elements of the 
	watch and check if they are all matching.
