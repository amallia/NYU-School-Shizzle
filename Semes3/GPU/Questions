PERSONAL NOTES:

Question about branch divergence:
When threads in a warp branch to different execution paths
50% loss
So to avoid, do we make sure our data input has the first (warp size threads) execute the same. So if we have a branch on ThreadID even or odd, should we make the data change so all first elements in the data are the odd and second all even?

Branch Divergence:
go from:
if (threadIdx.x > 2) to if (treadIdx.x/ WARP_SIZE > 2)

Constant memory works fast:

SIMT - Single instruction multiple threads.  The idea that the hardware executes the same instruction for all the threads in a warp at once
