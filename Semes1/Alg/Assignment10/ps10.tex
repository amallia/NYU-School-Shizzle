(if this is not ps#.tex, use the right file name)

  Clip out the ********* INSERT HERE ********* bits below and insert
appropriate TeX code.  Once you are done with your file, run

  ``latex ps#.tex''

from a UNIX prompt.  If your LaTeX code is clean, the latex will exit
back to a prompt.  To see intermediate results, type

  ``xdvi ps#.dvi'' (from UNIX prompt)
  ``yap ps#.dvi'' (if using MikTex in Windows)

after compilation. Once you are done, run

  ``dvips ps#.dvi''

which should print your file to the nearest printer.  There will be
residual files called ps#.log, ps#.aux, and ps#.dvi.  All these can be
deleted, but do not delete ps1.tex. To generate postscript file ps#.ps,
run

  ``dvips -o ps#.ps ps#.dvi''

I assume you know how to print .ps files (``lpr -Pprinter ps#.ps'')

\newproblem{Greedy Topological Sort}{12 (+4) points}

\begin{itemize}

\item[(a)] (3 points) Assume directed graph $G$ is acyclic. Show that $G$ has at least one
vertex $v$ having no outgoing edges.

\ifnum\me<2
\begin{solution}
Imagine $G$ as a graph that has all vertexes with outgoing edges, and that after traversing down all Vertexes except for one, we do not have a cycle.  We now have to analyze the last non visited Vertex, which we will label as $L$.  Now, if every node has an outgoing edge, then node $L$ will also have an outgoing edge.  Because all nodes other than $L$ have already been visited, and $L$ has an outgoing edge, then no matter what, $L$ will have an outgoing node to a node that has already been visited, therefore creating a cyclic Graph.  This shows that in order to have an acyclic graph, we need to have a Vertex with no outgoing edges.
\end{solution}
\fi

\item[(b)] (5 points) Consider the following greedy algorithm for topological
sort of a directed graph $G$: ``Find a vertex $v$ with no outgoing
edges. If no such $v$ exists, output `cyclic'. Else put $v$ as the
last vertex in the topological sort, remove $v$ from $G$ (by also
removing all incoming edges to $v$), and recurse on the remaining
graph $G'$ on $(n-1)$ vertices''. If this algorithm is correct, prove
it, else give a counter-example.

\item[(c)] (4 (+4) points) It is easy to implement the above algorithm in time
$O(mn)$. Show how to implement it in time $O(n^2)$. For {\bf extra
credit}, do it in time $O(m+n)$.

\newproblem{Minimizing Maximal Weight Edge}{6 points}

Recall, MST finds a spanning sub-tree $T$ of the original graph minimizing the sum of edge weights in $T$: $\sum_{e\in T} w(e)$. Consider a related problem MST$'$ which attempts to find a spanning sub-tree $T'$ of the original graph minimizing the maximum edge weight in $T'$: $\sum_{e\in T'} w(e)$.
Show that the solution $T$ to MST is also an optimal solution $T'$ to MST$'$, and vice versa.

\newproblem{Same weights}{10 points}

\begin{itemize}

\item[(a)] (4 points) Assume that all edge weights of an undirected graph $G$ are equal to the same number $w$. Design the fastest algorithm you can to compute the MST of $G$. Argue the correctness of the algorithm and state its run-time. Is it faster than the standard $O(m + n\log n)$ run-time of Prim?

\ifnum\me<2
\begin{solution}
***************** INSERT PROBLEM \prob a SOLUTION HERE ***************
\end{solution}
\fi

\item[(b)] (6 points) Now assume the all the edge weights are equal to $w$, except for a single edge $e'=(u',v')$ whose weight is $w'$ (note, $w'$ might be either larger or smaller than $w$). Show how to modify your solution in part (a) to compute the MST of $G$. What is the running time of your algorithm and how does it compare to the run-time you obtained in part (a) (or standard Prim)?

\ifnum\me<2
\begin{solution}
***************** INSERT PROBLEM \prob b SOLUTION HERE ***************
\end{solution}
\fi

\end{itemize}


\newproblem{Small Weights}{16 points}

Assume all edge weights in $G$ are integers from $1$ to $w$.

\begin{itemize}

\item[(a)] (8 points) Show how to modify Prim's algorithm to achieve running time $O(m+nw)$. Hence, if $w=O(1)$, you get optimal  time $O(m+n)$.

\ifnum\me<2
\begin{solution}
***************** INSERT PROBLEM \prob a SOLUTION HERE ***************
\end{solution}
\fi

\item[(b)] (4 points) Now assume $w=n$, so that the previous solution in part (a) is no longer faster than standard. Show how to modify Kruscal's algorithm instead of Prim's, so that it now takes time $O(m + n\log n)$, instead of $O(m\log n)$.

\ifnum\me<2
\begin{solution}
***************** INSERT PROBLEM \prob b SOLUTION HERE ***************
\end{solution}
\fi

\item[(c)] (4 points) What is the largest $w$ for which you can still maintain the
$O(m + n\log n)$ run-time in part $b$? In particular, can you tolerate $w=n^2$? $w=n^3$?

***************** INSERT PROBLEM \prob c SOLUTION HERE ***************
