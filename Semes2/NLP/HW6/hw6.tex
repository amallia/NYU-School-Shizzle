\large{\textit{I have printed all the data required to demonstrate these claims below.}} \\\\   
\large{\textit{This data includes tag accuracy and NP precision/recall/F-measure.}} \\\\   
We first want to compare if the feature of the word is better or worse than the feature of the current Pos.  When looking at just the word, we get an F-Measure of $0.74476$ whereas when we look at the Pos by itself we get an F-Measure of $0.8106$ roughly.  This shows us that individually, Pos is much more important that the word we are dealing with.
\\ \\
Next we will look at the combination of the two.  If we are looking at both the word and also the part of speech, we see that we have an F-Measure of $0.83412$.  This is a better measurement than when we are dealing with either the word or the Pos individually.  The two together is better than one.  \\ \\
\\ \\
So how can we get the best possible result?  I have tried different features and combinations of them all, the best I have found thus far is if we have a feature for the Current Word, The current part of speech, the previous part of speech, and if we are at the start of a sentence. With these 4 tags, i am able to get an F-Measure of roughly 0.88376, which I have found to be fairly good.
