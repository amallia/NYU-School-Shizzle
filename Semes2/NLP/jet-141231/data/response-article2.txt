<ngroup>NYU Shanghai</ngroup>, <ngroup>the university's third degree</ngroup>-granting <ngroup
>portal campus</ngroup>, continues to prepare for <ngroup>its inaugural class</ngroup> entering <ngroup
>next semester</ngroup>.
<ngroup>The campus</ngroup> will welcome <ngroup>a class</ngroup> of approximately 300 <ngroup
>students</ngroup> in <ngroup>the fall</ngroup>. <ngroup>Assistant Vice President</ngroup> for <ngroup
>Admissions Shawn Abbott</ngroup> said 51 <ngroup>percent</ngroup> of <ngroup>enrolled students</ngroup> will be <ngroup
>citizens</ngroup> of <ngroup>China</ngroup>. <ngroup>This decision</ngroup> was made as <ngroup
>a result</ngroup> of <ngroup>NYUSH</ngroup>'s <ngroup>partnership</ngroup> with the <ngroup
>Ministry</ngroup> of <ngroup>Education</ngroup> in <ngroup>China</ngroup>.
"<ngroup>This expectation</ngroup> is really no different than how <ngroup>many public universities</ngroup> in the <ngroup
>United States</ngroup> <ngroup>reserve</ngroup> <ngroup>spaces</ngroup> in <ngroup
>their freshman</ngroup> <ngroup>class</ngroup> for in-<ngroup>state</ngroup> <ngroup
>residents</ngroup>," <ngroup>he</ngroup> said.
<ngroup>This number</ngroup> is not <ngroup>an indication</ngroup> of <ngroup>easier admission</ngroup> for <ngroup
>Chinese students</ngroup>. <ngroup>Abbott</ngroup> explained that <ngroup>admissions</ngroup> will be selective for all <ngroup
>Chinese</ngroup> and <ngroup>international students</ngroup>, as <ngroup>the class</ngroup> <ngroup
>size</ngroup> is very small.
<ngroup>The idea</ngroup> of being <ngroup>a foreigner</ngroup> in <ngroup>a strange land</ngroup> appealed to <ngroup
>some applicants</ngroup>, like <ngroup>New Jersey</ngroup> <ngroup>high school</ngroup> <ngroup
>student</ngroup> <ngroup>Alex Opanasets</ngroup>, who was accepted through <ngroup
>early decision</ngroup> and said <ngroup>she</ngroup> was pleased to hear that <ngroup
>every international student</ngroup> will room with <ngroup>a Chinese student</ngroup>.
"<ngroup>There</ngroup> can't really be <ngroup>effective exposure</ngroup> to <ngroup
>global ideas</ngroup> and <ngroup>perspectives</ngroup> without <ngroup>ample representation</ngroup> from <ngroup
>the country</ngroup>," <ngroup>Opanasets</ngroup> said.
According to <ngroup>Opanasets</ngroup>, <ngroup>the current group</ngroup> of about 15 <ngroup
>early decision</ngroup> <ngroup>acceptances</ngroup> are already in <ngroup>contact</ngroup> with each other and include <ngroup
>students</ngroup> from 10 <ngroup>countries</ngroup> on four <ngroup>continents</ngroup>.

<ngroup>Joanna Waley</ngroup>-<ngroup>Cohen</ngroup>, <ngroup>dean</ngroup> of <ngroup
>Arts</ngroup> and <ngroup>Sciences</ngroup> at <ngroup>NYU Shanghai</ngroup>, expects <ngroup
>the interaction</ngroup> between <ngroup>the groups</ngroup> of <ngroup>students</ngroup> on <ngroup
>the portal campus</ngroup> to extend to <ngroup>students</ngroup> studying abroad in <ngroup
>Shanghai</ngroup>, as <ngroup>they</ngroup> will likely have overlapping <ngroup
>elective courses</ngroup>.
"<ngroup>It</ngroup>'s <ngroup>a wonderful thing</ngroup> for <ngroup>these Chinese freshmen</ngroup> to meet <ngroup
>the students</ngroup> from <ngroup>New York</ngroup>," <ngroup>Waley</ngroup>-<ngroup
>Cohen</ngroup> said. "<ngroup>These students</ngroup> will learn <ngroup>a lot</ngroup> from <ngroup
>each other culturally</ngroup> and within <ngroup>the classroom</ngroup>."
<ngroup>NYUSH</ngroup> <ngroup>faculty</ngroup> will also hail from both <ngroup
>China</ngroup> and the <ngroup>United States</ngroup>, underlining <ngroup>NYUSH</ngroup>'s <ngroup
>value</ngroup> in <ngroup>an integrated global network</ngroup>. <ngroup>Waley</ngroup>-<ngroup
>Cohen</ngroup> explained that <ngroup>a cohort</ngroup> of <ngroup>professors</ngroup> from <ngroup
>NYUNY</ngroup> will be going to <ngroup>NYUSH</ngroup> to teach.
The <ngroup>NYUSH</ngroup> <ngroup>class</ngroup> of 2017 will have required <ngroup
>courses</ngroup> that emphasize <ngroup>a global perspective</ngroup> by exploring <ngroup
>Chinese culture</ngroup>, including social and <ngroup>cultural foundations</ngroup>, writing, <ngroup
>language</ngroup>, <ngroup>English</ngroup> for <ngroup>Chinese students</ngroup> and <ngroup
>Chinese</ngroup> for <ngroup>non</ngroup>-<ngroup>Chinese students</ngroup>. After completing <ngroup
>this program</ngroup>, <ngroup>students</ngroup> will have <ngroup>a choice</ngroup> of <ngroup
>majors</ngroup> in <ngroup>the humanities</ngroup>, <ngroup>social sciences</ngroup> and <ngroup
>STEM</ngroup> <ngroup>fields</ngroup>.
<ngroup>Emily Flippen</ngroup>, <ngroup>a high school</ngroup> <ngroup>student</ngroup> from <ngroup
>Texas</ngroup> whose <ngroup>early decision</ngroup> <ngroup>application</ngroup> to <ngroup
>NYUSH</ngroup> was accepted in <ngroup>December</ngroup>, said <ngroup>she</ngroup> was disappointed <ngroup
>she</ngroup> could not immediately start <ngroup>classes</ngroup> in her desired major of <ngroup
>finance</ngroup> but thinks <ngroup>the core</ngroup> <ngroup>program</ngroup> will ultimately strengthen <ngroup
>the university</ngroup>.
"Living alongside <ngroup>Chinese students</ngroup>, going to <ngroup>the same classes</ngroup> and experiencing <ngroup
>the same city</ngroup> offers <ngroup>an invaluable opportunity</ngroup>, one that <ngroup
>I</ngroup> could not turn down," <ngroup>she</ngroup> said. "Making strong and <ngroup
>challenging courses</ngroup> in <ngroup>these required areas</ngroup> is going to be what allows <ngroup
>NYUSH</ngroup> to grow and attract <ngroup>more students</ngroup> internationally," <ngroup
>she</ngroup> said.
