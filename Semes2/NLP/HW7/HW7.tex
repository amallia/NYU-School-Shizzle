\textbf{Q1:} \\
Appointed Robert A. Niblock  as senior  vice president\\ 
Appointed Akbar Naderi  as vice chairman\\ \\ \\

\begin{verbatim}

These two are correct, but we are missing many many more classifications.
All other positions are not detected.  This is mostly because we are not 
correctly grabbing entire Noun groups, or also because the appointment patterns 
are also missing.  We do not have the feature of <Person>, <Position>.  
We also didn't have "Appointed <person> <position>".  
Also didn't have pattern for <Person> is appointed  <position>.


\end{verbatim}

These were all from the first half of the document.  There are more but too many to type out.  I am detecting a lot of incorrect patterns as well.  I have many more correct and also incorrect appointments found.  I believe it is because of my "coma" pattern that I created, but I am having troubles changing it so it has more accuracy in its detection.  With this assignment, I have learned that the appointment problem is a quite difficult process to automate.

I know you don't have to, but now that this assignment is submitted, I would love to see some more accurate patterns, for mine doesn't feel as accurate as it should be, but maybe that is just because this is a hard problem.
